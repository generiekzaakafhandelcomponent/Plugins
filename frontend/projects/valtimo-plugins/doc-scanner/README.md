# Document Scanner Plugin

The **Document Scanner** plugin is a Valtimo plugin that enables the scanning of documents (images or PDFs) and extracts
text using **Mistral OCR** (Optical Character Recognition). This functionality is especially useful for applications
that require automated text extraction from scanned or uploaded documents. The extracted text is returned in **Markdown
format**, allowing for easy formatting and further processing such as indexing, searching, or automated workflows.
